        <section id="variables">
            <p><h1>Variables</h1>
             You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.<br>
            <br>
            A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).<br>
            <br>
            You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
            <br></p>
        </section>
    

        <section id="constants">

            <p><h1>Constants</h1>
            You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
            <br>
            <br>
            const PI = 3.14;
            <br>
            <br>
            A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
            <br>
            <br>
            The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.
            <br>
            <br>
            You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:
            <br>
            <br>
            // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
            <br>
            CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
            <br>
            }
             <br>
             <br>
            However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.
            <br>
            <br>
            const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";
            </p>
        </section>
       

        <section id="data_types">
            <p><h1>Data types</h1>
                <br>
                The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:<br>
                <br>
                Six data types that are primitives:<br>
                <br>
                Boolean. true and false.<br>
                <br>
                null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.<br>
                <br>
                undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.<br>
                <br>
                Number. 42 or 3.14159.<br>
                <br>
                String. "Howdy"<br>
                <br>
                Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.<br>
                and Object<br>
                <br>
                Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.<br></p>

       <section id="if_else_statement">

<p><h1>if...else statement</h1>
Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }
condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.

You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
        } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }
      
In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:
if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
        statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
        statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
        statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }
It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }
If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:
if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }
